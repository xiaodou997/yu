# Changelog

## v0.3.0 (2026-07-02)

### Render Size Metadata API
- Added `measure_svg_dimensions` / `render_svg_with_dimensions` and a `--size` CLI flag so embedders can get exact output dimensions before rasterizing.
- CLI defaults to the diagram's natural dimensions (#83).

### Subgraph Containment Overhaul
- Sibling subgraph membership now matches mermaid-js (`flowDb.makeUniq`): a node belongs to the first subgraph that claims it, so referencing it in a later subgraph no longer forces boxes to overlap.
- New routing pass detours edges around subgraph boxes that contain neither endpoint.
- New placement pass evicts non-member nodes that visually land inside subgraph boxes.
- Hard gate is now 215 GREEN / 0 RED across the corpus (was 9 RED fixtures with 25 intruding edges).

### Layout and Routing Fixes
- Port-driven grid placement and port-aware routing for architecture-beta (#112, #59).
- Capped crossing-avoidance detours in flowchart route selection (#79).
- Hardened routing against empty candidate lists (#37).
- Fixed flowchart edge zig-zag and orbit artifacts; kept back-edge outer lanes through port refinement.
- Routed C4 connectors around intervening shapes.
- Separated state pseudostate markers from overlapping states.
- Fixed 'unexpected token end' for sequence frames and block-beta named groups (#102).
- Fixed gantt task ids ending in a duration letter being misparsed.

### Themes and Styling
- Added dark/forest/neutral theme presets and `--theme` CLI flag (#73).
- Fixed pie slice colors, legend overlap (#69), and CJK title clipping (#112).
- Added `mindmap.edgeColor` config (#49).

### Quality Gates and Detection
- Hard gate gained semantic containment predicates (foreign-node containment, member escape), label-overflow, and canvas-overflow detectors.
- Layout dumps now expose edge label anchors/extents for external metric tooling.
- Added determinism, invariant, semantic, and output-shape suites plus baseline ratcheting.

### Packaging
- Release builds use fat LTO (#13); arm64 release artifacts (#71); Nix flake (#99).

## v0.2.2 (2026-04-23)

### Visual and Layout Fixes
- Fixed sequence diagram `alt` frame geometry and prevented wide section labels from panicking layout.
- Fixed compact flowchart label decorations.
- Made dotted edges visually distinct from solid edges.
- Fixed class diagram stereotypes being rendered as members.
- Fixed class diagram arrowheads being hidden under node boxes.
- Fixed state diagram description lines so titles are preserved and descriptions accumulate.
- Fixed empty-subgraph layout panic by keeping graph-level and local subgraph indexes mapped correctly.

### Rendering and Theme Fixes
- Fixed invalid non-ASCII hex color values causing panics.
- Preserved quoted font-family normalization for SVG text output.

### Gantt
- Added compact Gantt display mode via YAML frontmatter (`displayMode: compact`).

### Dependencies and Release
- Updated `anyhow`, `clap`, `criterion`, `regex`, and release action dependencies.
- Added release workflow automation for Homebrew and AUR package updates.

## v0.2.0 (2026-02-07)

### Layout Engine Overhaul
- Rewrote flowchart layout with improved routing, subgraph compaction, and tighter node spacing
- Auto-place edge labels with collision-aware search grid
- Added edge label relaxation for Flowchart, State, ER, and Requirement diagrams
- Node overlap resolver now runs for all diagram types when overlaps are detected
- Finer-grained label placement search for closer label-to-edge proximity

### Visual Quality Improvements
- Redesigned ER diagram tables with cleaner styling
- Redesigned pie charts with improved label readability
- Redesigned journey diagram layout
- Improved state diagram composite labels and marker sizing
- Improved gantt chart rendering: section bands, color coding, in-bar labels
- Improved mindmap, class, and flowchart rendering polish
- Compact subgraph sizing across diagram types

### Parser Fixes
- Parse `-- "text" -->` quoted edge label syntax (fixes #27)

### Performance
- Added font cache for text metrics — avoids redundant font lookups
- Added `--fastText` option for approximate text width metrics

### Benchmarking & Quality
- Layout quality scoring vs mermaid-cli
- 16 new stress fixtures for benchmarks
- Expanded comparison examples across all diagram types
- Sankey link path detection in quality checks

## v0.1.3 (2026-02-02)

Initial public release with 13 diagram types and 100-1400x performance vs mermaid-cli.
